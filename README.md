In this project the challenge was to create a landing page based on the following instruction:

- Recreate the layout observable in the provided example image.
- Created page should be responsive and abide by three distinct size categories. One for desktop, one for tablets and finally, one for mobile. The applicant is responsible for deciding how the page responds.
- In the "Say Hello to a Full Service Plan" section, the icons should be replaced by others on mouseover.
- In the final "Schedule a demo" button, after clicking, a popup should appear with three fields: Name, Email, Phone. If the user tries to enter an invalid email syntax in the email field, a validation message should be triggered.
- Upon loading the page, a welcome popup with the message "Youlead Exercise" should appear onLoad and automatically close after 5 seconds.
- After producing the first page, create a clone of the HTML file and include a variation in the header of the page. Change the dark blue to a dark green to light green gradient vertically.

This a native HTML/CSS/JS project.
